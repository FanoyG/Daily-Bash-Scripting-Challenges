# Intermediate Level - Bash Scripting Challenge

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This section contains **15 intermediate-level Bash scripting problems** along with their solutions.  
The goal is to strengthen your understanding of Bash scripting concepts such as:
- Variables and user input
- Conditional statements
- Loops and arithmetic operations
- String and file manipulations

## ðŸ«  Prerequisites
Before attempting these problems, you should be familiar with:
- **Variables** (`VAR=value`)
- **User Input** using `read`
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations** (`expr`, `$(( ))`)
- **If-Else Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Loop Structures** (`for`, `while`, `until`)
- **Basic String Manipulations**

## ðŸ—‚ File Structure
- **BH-Inter_Pb_15.md** â†’ Contains the **problem statements**.
- **BH-Inter_As_15.sh** â†’ Contains the **solutions** to all problems.
- **Pre-Request.md** â†’ This file, which explains prerequisites and how to use the files.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. **Navigate to the Intermediate directory**:
   ```sh
   cd Intermediate
   ```
2. Read the problems in **BH-Inter_Pb_15.md**.
3. Try solving the problems on your own before checking **BH-Inter_As_15.sh**.
4. To run all solutions, execute:
   ```sh
   chmod +x BH-Inter_As_15.sh
   ./BH-Inter_As_15.sh
   ```
5. To test a single solution, copy the required snippet from **BH-Inter_As_15.sh** and run it separately.
